#Contribution README 

**If you want to contribute, do a pull request with the following format:**

If it's for a language that is not yet added in this repo, create a new folder/directory with the programming language name (eg. Javascript) you intend to add. Else if it is there already and you want to contribute on how it is being use in different technology or abstraction, then create a sub-directory under that specific language.

For example: 
	Javascript
	|___Vanilla Javascript
	|	|___README.md 
	|	|___Sample Codes
	|	|___hello_world_vanilla_javascript.png
	|
	|___Jquery
	|___Node.JS
	|___React.JS
	|___Angular.JS
	|___ES2015


Inside the folder:

1. Create a README.md with the following content:
	[See Link Here]() - Still working on this.

2. Sample Code - Folder Name: **Hello World React.JS**

3. If you want to add in images that you want to reference later on your README.md file, name your image based on the specific language/technology that you are doing. And add it in the sample folder.
